This simulation sets a single bump 2D attractor model and varies two parameters

  * Input driving current
  * Coupling between neurons (strength of inhibitory and excitatory synapses)

Here we are mainly looking at the stability of the bump over a specified period
of time (its variance).


job1-100
Network size = 30x30 E neurons and 30x30 inhibitory neurons

job200-500 the same as job1-100 repeated (so that the network will be constructed differently)
