Here we are looking at the stability of the bump. Since in these kind of
simulations we are generating networks with random connection probability rules,
some networks might be generated so that they are very sensitive to any
fluctuations.

Here we generate many variants of the connectivity for networks with exactly the
same parameters (size, spread of Mexican hat, etc.) and compare the resulting
variance of bump position.
