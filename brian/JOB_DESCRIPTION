job6000   - checking whether different membrane time constants produce stable
            hexagonal patterns in the population response
job7000   - checking for stable path integration, based on job6000
job8000   - stable firing fields for taum=10, taui=1? 20 repeats
job9000   - firing fields with different lambda_net

job16000 to
job19000  - either stable firing fields or hexagonal movement test

Final jobs
----------

job20000  - Test path integration precision as a function of sheet size
job21000  - Estimate how lambda_net influences blob spacing
job22000  - New path integration tests - with Hafting rat position data which do
            not contain abrupt shift in the middle of the simulation
job22100  - Path integration tests - alpha = 0.015
job22200  - Path integration tests - alpha = 0.013, lambda_net=13

job23000  - 30s of simulation with SN membrane responses (one row in the middle
            of the sheet, monitor dt = 1ms)
job23100  - 50s, monitor_dt=0.1ms, otherwise same as job23000
