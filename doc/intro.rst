Introduction
============

This documentation is for the two-population spiking continuous attrator
network model that is based on [PASTOLL2013]_. However this is an updated
version and is the basis for a publication in preparation by [SOLANKA2015]_.
With this code it is possible to reproduce all the data necesary to build all
the figures in [SOLANKA2015]_, as well as use the already created (and soon to
be published) data set that was used to prepare the publication.

The project source code is located in a `git repository
