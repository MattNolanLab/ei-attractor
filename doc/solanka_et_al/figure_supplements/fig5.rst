Supplement for Figure 5
-----------------------

Supplement 1 -- Raster plots of network activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This figure supplement, again, uses data from the simulations of stationary
bump attractors. You therefore need to complete Section
:ref:`bumps_common_3noise`. Once this is done, change your working directory to
``grid_cell_model/simulations/007_noise/figures/paper`` and run::

    $ ./suppFigure_seizure_examples.py

The generated files are in ``panels/`` and are named ``raster_examples_*.pdf``.
There is no AI file for this figure supplement.
