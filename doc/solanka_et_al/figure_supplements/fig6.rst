Supplements for Figure 6
------------------------

Supplement 1 -- Gamma activity in networks without theta frequency inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This figure supplement requires data generated by networks simulating
stationary attractors without theta input. These simulations are described in
Section :ref:`no_theta_bumps`. There is no need to run velocity calibration and
animal movement simulations in this case. Once the data is generated and
analyzed, switch to
``grid_cell_model/simulations/007_noise/figures/paper/no_theta`` and run::

    $ ./figure_gamma.py

The generated panels (in the ``panels`` sub-directory) have the
``paper_gamma_`` prefix and the assembled figure is in
``ai/paper_figure_gamma.ai``.


Supplement 2 -- Difference in gridness score in networks without theta frequency inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not described yet. Perhaps at some point in the future.


Supplement 3 -- Mean firing rate of E cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not described yet. Perhaps at some point in the future.


Supplement 4 -- Velocity gain calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This figure supplement requires data from the *Velocity calibration
simulations* in Section :ref:`grids_main_3noise` (you have to also perform the
'aggregation' step). When the data is ready, change your working directory to
``grid_cell_model/simulations/007_noise/figures/paper`` and run::

    $ ./suppFigure_velocity.py

The panels generated for this figure are the following:

    * ``suppFigure_velocity_err_sweeps*.pdf``

    * ``velocity_slope_examples_*.pdf``

    * ``velocity_slope_sweeps*.pdf``

The assembled figure is in ``ai/suppFigure_velocity.ai``.


Supplement 5 -- Effectivity of place cell inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not described yet. Perhaps at some point in the future.
