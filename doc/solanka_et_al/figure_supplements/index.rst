How to reproduce Figure supplements
-----------------------------------

There are very similar scripts to run simulations and generate figures for the
supplements as well. Some of them use the data already generated by the scripts
for the main figures, some of them need the whole cycles of velocity
calibration / grid field simulations. You can find the simulation scripts in
``grid_cell_model/simulations/007_noise`` and the figure generation sripts in
the ``figures/paper`` sub-directory.
