This package defines all the higher level models (i.e. python based). For the
nest model, have a look at ../nest/

There are also some associated sctructures for saving and loading data defined
here.

Package structure:
    
    custombrian.py
        Custom-made models derived from brian classes

    datamanip.py
        Interface for saving and loading simulation data independently of the
        exact file format.

    gc_net.py 
        Base class for the grid cell network. Simulator independent

    gc_net_brian.py
        Brian specific implementation of the grid cell network.

    gc_net_nest.py
        NEST specific implementation of the grid cell network

    parameters.py
        Grid cell network generic parameters

    place_cells.py
        Place cell simulation model

    place_input.py
        Place cell input *current* (no explicit place cells).
