This package defines all the higher level models (i.e. python based). For the
nest model, have a look at ../nest/

Package structure:
    
    custombrian.py

    gc_net_nest.py
        NEST specific implementation of the grid cell network

    parameters.py
        Grid cell network generic parameters

    place_cells.py
