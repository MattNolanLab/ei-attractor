= Reconciling different versions of the grid attractor model to make new
predictions =

 - Different versions of the synaptic profile
    - Mexican hat with uniform inhibition
    - Mexican hat without uniform inhibition
    - Competitive (Couey et al.)

 - How do these different profiles generate attractors in spiking network
   models?

 - To what extent do these different profiles enable emergence of theta-nested
   gamma oscillations?
