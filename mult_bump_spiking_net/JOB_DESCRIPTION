job6000   - checking whether different membrane time constants produce stable
            hexagonal patterns in the population response
job7000   - checking for stable path integration, based on job6000
job8000   - stable firing fields for taum=10, taui=1? 20 repeats
job9000   - firing fields with different lambda_net

job16000 to
job19000  - either stable firing fields or hexagonal movement test

Final jobs
----------

job20000  - Test path integration precision as a function of sheet size
job21000  - Estimate how lambda_net influences blob spacing
job21300  - Static responses - to estimate distance between blobs
job21400  - Static responses - to test whether the blobs move without velocity
job21500  - Static responses - lambda_net=13&20; 20 repeats
job21600  - the same as 21500, but repeated 80 times to produce 100 recordings
job21800  - The preferred directions have been changed to cancel each other in
            both rows and columns, 100 repeats with lambda_net = 13
job21900  - zero velocity, l = 0, 100 repeats
job22000  - zero velocity, preferred directions are randomly distibuted, 100
            repeats
job22100  - zero velocity, preferred direction are again systematic, trying
            lambda_net = 16.667
job30000  - zero velocity, preferred directions are again systematic - NS -
            trying l=1 instead of l=2, with lambda_net=16.667
job30100  - zero velocity, preferred directions are
            NW
            SE
            lambda_net = 13, l = 2

job22000  - New path integration tests - with Hafting rat position data which do
            not contain abrupt shift in the middle of the simulation
job22100  - Path integration tests - alpha = 0.015
job22200  - Path integration tests - alpha = 0.013, lambda_net=13

job23000  - 30s of simulation with SN membrane responses (one row in the middle
            of the sheet, monitor dt = 1ms)
job23100  - 50s, monitor_dt=0.1ms, otherwise same as job23000
job23200  - 50s single neuron responses, included synaptic conductance
job23300  - 50s single neuron responses, rat moving to the right all the time
job23400  - rat moving up/down
job23500  - rat not moving at all
job23600  - the same - monitoring diagonal instead of row in the middle of the
            sheet


PhD. project initial testing jobs
---------------------------------

job40000  - 100 zero velocity runs, preferred directions distributed according
            to the Burak&Fiete, 2009 paper
