Experiment description
----------------------

Test whether proper initial conditions of membrane potential can influence bump
stability.

Hypothesis: Because membrane potential of neurons is initialized randomly, it might happen that the network does not start from a proper hexagonal bumps state. This might cause instabilities in the network.

- The network will start from fixed initial conditions - proper bump with respect to network parameters (saved in file)
- Gaussian noise will (can) be added to initial conditions.
- No other noise in the network

- This will be compared to the case when neurons' membrane potentials are initialized randomly
